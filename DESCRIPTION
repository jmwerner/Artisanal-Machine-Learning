Description: As an exercise of professional development (but mostly for funzies)
    I will be writing many of the machine learning algorithms I know and love
    completely by hand from scratch. Doing such will help me achieve a 100 percent
    bullet-proof understanding of the algorithms and their deepest inner-workings.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.3.1),
    ggplot2 (>= 2.1.0),
    viridis (>= 0.3.4)
Suggests:
    testthat (>= 1.0.2),
    knitr,
    rmarkdown
